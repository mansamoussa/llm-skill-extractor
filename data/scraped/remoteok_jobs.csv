https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/remote-product-engineer-posthog-1128992,Product Engineer,PostHog,"Full Stack, Developer, Engineer, Python, Rust, JavaScript, Typescript, React, Angular, Vue, Pyton, Django, Golang","PostHog posthog.com Apply now Share this job: PostHog is hiring a Remote Product Engineer About PostHog We're shipping every product that companies need to run their business from their first day, to the day they IPO, and beyond. The operating system for folks who build software. We started with open-source product analytics, launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort . We've since shipped more than a dozen products , including: A built-in data warehouse , so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights. A customer data platform , so they can send their data wherever they need with ease. PostHog AI , an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries. Next on the roadmap are CRM, messaging, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it! We are: Product-led . More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit. Default alive . Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on. Well-funded. We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top investors . We're set up for a long, ambitious journey. We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as weird as possible . Things we care about Transparency: Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our public company handbook . Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions. Autonomy: We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead product teams and make product decisions . Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed. Shipping fast: Why not now? We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end. Time for building: Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs > Issues > Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are meeting-free days , and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had. Ambition: We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there. Being weird: Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally every product that relates to customer data. It means building an objectively unnecessary developer toy with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun. Who we're looking for We're hiring for a range of roles here. What you end up working on will depend on your exact skillset and preferences, so choose your own adventure. In general we seek Product Engineers who are: Enthusiastic drivers. We need proactive people that can fully own projects and get them done, and know to get help when needed. This is what being a product engineer is all about. ""Are we there yet?"" is the wrong question. Optimistic problem solvers. Things get hard here sometimes – whether it's scaling, shipping complex products, handling a stream of support requests, or trying to ship something that touches multiple teams. We need people who won't get disheartened, and will collaborate, iterate, and ship their way out of anything. Grown ups. We’re an international bunch of weirdos, but one thing unites us: everyone is kind, considerate, and professional towards each other. This isn't about age or experience , it's about being low-ego, flexible, and respectful. Genuine builders. PostHog is full of people who just love building stuff, people who would still be building software even if there wasn't a paycheck at the end. If this sounds like you, we should talk. Right now, we are also looking for: IAM specialist: You’ll design and ship core features like SAML support, new identity providers, and even our own IAM system. Start with internal tooling, then roll them out to customers. Tell us how you’d make these systems so solid that other teams can build on them without hesitation. What you'll be doing Owning products and features from beginning to end. This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means iterating on their feedback , owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work. Collaborating with design (when necessary). Product engineers at PostHog are full stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using our design system . From there, it's up to you to decide when to collaborate with our design team to iterate and polish the experience. Talking to users. Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things. Doing support. Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the Support hero . Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers, and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time, is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some on-call time , too. Writing docs. We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it. Requirements Full-stack experience with relevant technologies – e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus. Experience taking a project from 0 to 1. You might have led a project, been a founder previously, or built an impressive side project. Strong writing skills. We document everything , most of it publicly. The ability to communicate your ideas and make persuasive arguments is essential. Nice to have Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before. Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React. Experience building AI-native products, or integrating AI into existing software. If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!

As AI has advanced, Warp has evolved beyond its terminal roots into the platform for Agentic Development: a workbench for dispatching agents to code, deploy, and debug production software. With over 700k active developers and revenue that has grown over 20x this year so far, Warp is now one of the fastest growing startups in the exploding AI development space. We believe that soon developers will be “tech leads” for groups of agents; rather than opening a code editor to write code or a terminal to write commands, they will open Warp and prompt their computer to build features, fix bugs, and diagnose production issues. With its starting point as a reimagined command line, Warp is well-positioned to support agent-first workflows: It sits at the lowest level in the dev stack, has access to all of a developer’s context, and is set up for multitasking and long-running processes. In addition, Warp has state-of-the-art code editing features and built-in team knowledge sharing. It’s the right interface for the agentic future.

https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/remote-product-engineer-posthog-1128992,Product Engineer,PostHog,"Full Stack, Developer, Engineer, Rust, JavaScript, Typescript, React, Angular, Vue, Pyton, Django, Golang","PostHog posthog.com Apply now Share this job: PostHog is hiring a Remote Product Engineer About PostHog We're shipping every product that companies need to run their business from their first day, to the day they IPO, and beyond. The operating system for folks who build software. We started with open-source product analytics, launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort . We've since shipped more than a dozen products , including: A built-in data warehouse , so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights. A customer data platform , so they can send their data wherever they need with ease. PostHog AI , an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries. Next on the roadmap are CRM, messaging, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it! We are: Product-led . More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit. Default alive . Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on. Well-funded. We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top investors . We're set up for a long, ambitious journey. We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as weird as possible . Things we care about Transparency: Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our public company handbook . Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions. Autonomy: We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead product teams and make product decisions . Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed. Shipping fast: Why not now? We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end. Time for building: Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs > Issues > Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are meeting-free days , and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had. Ambition: We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there. Being weird: Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally every product that relates to customer data. It means building an objectively unnecessary developer toy with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun. Who we're looking for We're hiring for a range of roles here. What you end up working on will depend on your exact skillset and preferences, so choose your own adventure. In general we seek Product Engineers who are: Enthusiastic drivers. We need proactive people that can fully own projects and get them done, and know to get help when needed. This is what being a product engineer is all about. ""Are we there yet?"" is the wrong question. Optimistic problem solvers. Things get hard here sometimes – whether it's scaling, shipping complex products, handling a stream of support requests, or trying to ship something that touches multiple teams. We need people who won't get disheartened, and will collaborate, iterate, and ship their way out of anything. Grown ups. We’re an international bunch of weirdos, but one thing unites us: everyone is kind, considerate, and professional towards each other. This isn't about age or experience , it's about being low-ego, flexible, and respectful. Genuine builders. PostHog is full of people who just love building stuff, people who would still be building software even if there wasn't a paycheck at the end. If this sounds like you, we should talk. Right now, we are also looking for: IAM specialist: You’ll design and ship core features like SAML support, new identity providers, and even our own IAM system. Start with internal tooling, then roll them out to customers. Tell us how you’d make these systems so solid that other teams can build on them without hesitation. What you'll be doing Owning products and features from beginning to end. This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means iterating on their feedback , owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work. Collaborating with design (when necessary). Product engineers at PostHog are full stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using our design system . From there, it's up to you to decide when to collaborate with our design team to iterate and polish the experience. Talking to users. Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things. Doing support. Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the Support hero . Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers, and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time, is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some on-call time , too. Writing docs. We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it. Requirements Full-stack experience with relevant technologies – e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus. Experience taking a project from 0 to 1. You might have led a project, been a founder previously, or built an impressive side project. Strong writing skills. We document everything , most of it publicly. The ability to communicate your ideas and make persuasive arguments is essential. Nice to have Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before. Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React. Experience building AI-native products, or integrating AI into existing software. If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!

As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, drier fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos. About Pano: We are a 130+ person growth-stage hybrid-remote start-up, headquartered in San Francisco. We are the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safely—with the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordination—so that they can stop a new ignition before it grows. Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

The Data Products team enables customers to rapidly create, govern, and iterate on high-quality behavioral data products that fuel AI-powered applications. We transform the complex process of data creation from weeks to days through intuitive design tools, automated code generation, and comprehensive governance capabilities. We believe in supporting engineers to have autonomy and responsibility to make decisions, taking ownership of the product from technical design to code to customer. The ideal fit will be an engineer who loves to learn and take on new challenges, and can solve a variety of problems to ensure the success of the overall service, in partnership with our product and customer-facing teams. If you are growth-oriented, passionate about technology, and excited about building exceptional UIs and complex business services, we want to hear from you! What you’ll be doing: ● Working on our Typelevel Scala backend services and our React single-page application. ● Embracing AI coding assistants to delegate the boring, repetitive tasks while focusing on the creative, important work. We believe in AI as an enabler of velocity improvements, while being cognizant of the constraints; and deploy its strengths intentionally. ● Building robust QA, unit and integration tests. ● Writing top documentation about the features you help deliver. ● Taking turns to investigate our customers’ escalated tickets and respond (we don’t do on-call rotations, not yet at least). ● Collaborating in Scrum ceremonies and engage with cross-functional teams for requirements. ● Managing CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments and reliability. ● Monitoring system health with observability tools and address issues proactively. ● Engaging with stakeholders for alignment on project goals and updates. ● Researching new technologies to improve the Snowplow ecosystem. We’d love to hear from you if: ● You have professional experience building 1) RESTful APIs with Typelevel Scala, and 2) engaging user experiences for the Web with Typescript and React. ● You understand API and browser performance, as well as web accessibility standards. ● You have an array of tools under your belt to support making a web application faster and more accessible. ● You place maximum emphasis on security. Data security and integrity are fundamental to what we do, so you’ll need a solid understanding of security threats and how to overcome them. ● Nice to have, not necessary: Golang and Python experience would come very handy, for a few repositories outside of the critical path.
