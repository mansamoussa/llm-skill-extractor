        "### Objective\n",
        "Extract professional skills from job advertisements using a Large Language Model (OpenAI GPT) after identifying the relevant \"Skills and Content\" zones with our fine-tuned BERT model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will:\n",
        "1. Load the fine-tuned BERT model from Task 2 (zone identification)\n",
        "2. Load job advertisement data (both annotated and scraped datasets)\n",
        "3. Use BERT to identify \"Fähigkeiten und Inhalte\" (Skills and Content) zones\n",
        "4. Extract those text sections containing skills\n",
        "5. Use OpenAI GPT API to intelligently extract individual professional skills\n",
        "6. Structure and save the extracted skills in JSON format\n",

        "### Why This Task is Important\n",
        "The BERT model from Tasks 1-3 can identify WHERE skills are mentioned in a job ad, but it cannot extract the SPECIFIC skills themselves. This is a perfect task for a Large Language Model (LLM) because:\n",
        "- LLMs understand context and can identify implicit skills\n",
        "- They can handle multilingual text (German, French, English)\n",
        "- They can normalize skill names (e.g., \"JS\" → \"JavaScript\")\n",
        "- They can distinguish between skills and other job requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "### Input Data\n",
        "- `model/best_model.pt` — fine-tuned BERT model from Task 2\n",

        "1. **Zone Identification (BERT)**: Used fine-tuned multilingual BERT to identify text sections labeled as \"Fähigkeiten und Inhalte\" (Skills and Content)\n",

        "3. **Categorization**: Organized skills into 6 categories: technical skills, soft skills, languages, tools, certifications, and other skills\n",
        "4. **Dual LLM Support**: Implemented support for both OpenAI and Gemini APIs, allowing comparison and choice of best model\n",
